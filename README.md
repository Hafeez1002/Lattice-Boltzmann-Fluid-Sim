# Lattice-Boltzmann-Fluid-Sim
Iâ€™ve developed a fluid simulation code using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), an alternative to the traditional Navier-Stokes methods. This approach models the fluid as a collection of fictive particles that move and interact on a lattice, providing a unique way to simulate fluid behaviour
